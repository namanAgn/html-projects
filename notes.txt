Mindset:
You’re going mainly for exposure — to learn teamwork, manage stress, and see how hackathons flow. It’s not high stakes. Stay curious.

Social approach:

Don’t force fittingin. Observe first. Speak when it adds something. Be polite, focused, a bit witty.
When unsure—ask simple clarifying questions (“should we divide by UI / backend / logic?”).
Mirror their pace and tone instead of overcompensating.

Team strategy:

Suggest limiting scope so the site feels personal and easy to debug.
Mention that clean, human-written code looks better to judges than AI spam.
Offer to handle UI if they agree—it plays to your strengths.
Keep commits organized, with short messages that explain purpose.

Speaking & confidence:

Swallow saliva every few minutes to avoid sticky mouth.
Talk slowly, clearly; don’t rush to fill silence.
Quiet + steady = confident.
Light humor is fine once you sense comfort. Avoid edgy jokes early.

Equipment & comfort:

Use laptop keyboard—it’s enough for 4 hours.
Bring charger, water, and maybe a small notepad for logic flow.

Mental prep:

Expect small awkward moments; don’t label them failures.
Focus on what you can control—code, attitude, clarity.

Sleep early. Don’t rehearse imaginary conversations.
