Study + Habit Dashboard – Feature Summary
Core Purpose

Track study tasks and hobbies.

Motivate consistent progress through points and accountability.

Reinforce long-term habits and short-term experiments.

Task System

Study Tasks

Each study task has a completion button.

Tasks can be high-priority / highly rewarding → more points.

Time spent studying tracked via timer → additional points based on duration.

Types:

Quick completion tasks (button press only)

Form-based tasks (asks duration, ensures honesty for longer tasks)

Hobbies

Short-term: Temporary actions/events (e.g., sleep earlier for 1 week).

Cannot edit/remove until completed X times.

Points awarded for completion; points deducted for skipping.

Long-term: Continuous habits (e.g., get fitter, daily 15 min with Giddu, outside once daily).

Cannot remove/edit for minimum duration (e.g., 3 months).

Points awarded for completion; points deducted for skipping.

Each hobby has a button to mark completion.

Points System

Tasks and hobbies earn points when completed.

High-priority / high-reward tasks earn more points.

Duration-based tasks scale points by time logged via timer.

Skipping mandatory tasks or failing to click buttons subtracts points.

Daily points sum up to a day total → replaces “day efficiency” metric.

Timers

Start timer per task/hobby when working.

Longer focused effort = more points.

Encourages sustained focus, discourages drift.

Task Enforcement Rules

Short-term hobbies: must meet completion threshold to be editable or removable.

Long-term hobbies: locked for set duration; skipping deducts points.

Form-based tasks: app asks if user is genuine; logs duration if user confirms.

UI / Interaction
